### Creating sample data for Employee Table
create table employee
(
emp_name varchar(10),
dep_id int,
salary int
);
delete from employee;
insert into employee values 
('Siva',1,30000),('Ravi',2,40000),('Prasad',1,50000),('Sai',2,20000),('Raj',25000);

## Code starts from here
### Step 1: Created a CTE and written a logic to derive dep wise which emp is having maximum/minimum salary . 
## Step 2: Find salary difference
## Step 3: Find the emp_name and dep_id having max and min salary
## Step 4: Perform an inner join on dep_id to get the highest and lowest salaried employee


WITH Max_MinSal AS (
Select *,
Salary-Max(salary) over (partition by dep_id order by emp_name) AS MAX_Salary_diff,
Salary-Min(salary) over (partition by dep_id order by emp_name desc) AS Min_Salary_diff
from employee
),

MAX_sal AS (
Select emp_name As emp_name_max_salary, dep_id
from Max_MinSal 
where MAX_Salary_diff=0
),

MIN_Sal AS (
Select emp_name As emp_name_min_salary, dep_id
from Max_MinSal 
where Min_Salary_diff=0
)


Select MX.dep_id,MX.emp_name_max_salary,MN.emp_name_min_salary from MAX_sal MX Inner Join MIN_Sal MN on MX.dep_id=MN.dep_id
