# Question: There is phonelog having call history, we need to find the callers whose first and last call was to same perosn in a given day
# Solution:
 With Calllogs As (
select 
Callerid,
Date(Datecalled) AS Date_called,
Max(Datecalled) As First_call,
Min(Datecalled) As Last_call
from phonelog
group by Callerid,Date(Datecalled)
)

Select c.*,p1.Recipientid from Calllogs c 
Inner Join phonelog p1 on p1.Callerid=c.Callerid and p1.Datecalled=c.First_call
Inner Join phonelog p2 on p2.Callerid=c.Callerid and p2.Datecalled=c.last_call
where p1.Recipientid = p2.Recipientid
